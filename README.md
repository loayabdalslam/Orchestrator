# Orchestrator: AI Agent Development Framework

---

## Overview
Orchestrator is a powerful framework designed to streamline the creation and management of AI agents using advanced AI models like **Google Gemini**. It provides a structured pipeline for project planning, code generation, deployment, and security management, making it easier to develop intelligent systems.

---

## Features
- **AI-Powered Project Planning**: Automatically generate project structures, tasks, and code artifacts using AI.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Includes specialized agents for project management, development, and DevOps.
- **Code Review & Validation**: Built-in code review system to ensure quality and security.
- **Interactive Console UI**: User-friendly interface for managing projects and tasks.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily integrate with different AI providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama).
- **Database & Migration Support**: Manage database configurations and apply migrations seamlessly.
- **Security Integration**: Add security dependencies and create secure environment templates.

---

## Project Plan
The project is divided into the following components:

1. **Core Components**:
   - **Logger**: Enhanced logging system with colored output and database storage.
   - **DatabaseManager**: Handles database configurations and migrations.
   - **ConsoleUI**: Interactive console interface for user interaction.

2. **AI Model Components**:
   - **ModelConfig**: Configuration for AI models (provider, model name, API key).
   - **AIModel**: Wrapper for interacting with AI providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama).

3. **Agents**:
   - **ProjectManager**: Generates project plans, tasks, and structures.
   - **DeveloperAgent**: Writes and reviews code artifacts.
   - **DevOpsAgent**: Handles project deployment and file management.
   - **SecurityManager**: Adds security dependencies and creates secure templates.
   - **CodeReviewer**: Conducts automated code reviews.

4. **Orchestrator**:
   - Coordinates the workflow between agents and executes the project pipeline.
